<h1>Bodybuilding</h1>

<h2>My Hobby</h2>

<p> My favorite hobby is bodybuilding. I competed in my first
show, the NPC Palmetto Classic, on May 7th, 2016. I won my
first show and fell in love with the process of preparing
for a show and the act of competing. While I am taking a
break in bodybuilding to compete in powerlifting, I will
have two bodybuilding shows in 2016. My first show will be
another national qualifier, while my second show will be the 
nationals in Pittsburg where I will compete for the NPC 
National teen's championship, the most prestigious title in 
teenage bodybuilding.</p>

<h3> My Start in Bodybuilding</h3>

<p> My first competition was in 2016 at the age of 17, however
my passion for bodybuiding and weight training itself began
much earlier. My father, Olly Pierce, was once a competitive 
bodybuilder himself his interest in bodybuiding caused him
to open his own gym. At the age of twelve I wanted to begin 
weight training seriously, I fell in love with the activity 
immediately and have done it practically every day since.After
five years of training I decided it was time to finally take
the stage. 



<h4> The History of Bodybuilding</h4>

<p> Today bodybuilding is considered a fairly well known sport
and while it may be misunderstood there are still thousands
of proffesional and amateur competitors annually.Throughout 
the 19th and early 20th century bodybuilding was considedered
a taboo spectacle worthy of being viewed at a circus. One of 
the major changes of the public's opinion on bodybuilding 
began due to the creation of the Mr. Olympia contest, the 
bodybuilding show designated to be largest possible stage for 
a bodybuilder crowning the top competitor in the world. The 
first Mr Olympia crowned Larry Scott the champion in 1965, 
however it was not until the 7 time Mr. Olympia

Arnold Schwarzenneger</a> took the stage in the film "Pumping Iron" 
when
bodybuiding experienced a boom of social interest. After the 
release of "Pumping Iron" bodybuilding, and weight training in 
general, socially became a well known aspect of modern life.

<h5> Modern Day Bodybuilding </h5>

<p> While the Mr Olympia Contest started with the champion
being Larry Scott in 1965 the competition and sport itself
has gone through many changes in the last fifty years. One of
these changes is the extreme size difference in the
competitors at the IFBB pro level today, compared to the much
smaller competitors in the early stages of professional
bodybuilding. While in the earlier days many of the
athletes competed around 225 or 230 pounds, today a large
amount of the participants, such as

com/files/styles/gallery_slide_612xany/public/media/_PB25769
.jpg?itok=OOZQ_N_N"> Dallas Mcarver </a>, compete 
weighing closer to 300pounds! Another major difference is the 
ability to create a 
career out of this passion. While it is still difficult, the 
top competitors can gross seven figures annually through
contest wins, sponsorships, and promoting themselves on social
media. To highlight the drastic change in salary the first 
place winner of the Mr Olympia show in September of 2016 will 
take home the prize money of $1,000,000 compared to the 
earnings of Arnold Schwarzenneger's first six shows combined
which only grossed to a total of $7,500. </p>
